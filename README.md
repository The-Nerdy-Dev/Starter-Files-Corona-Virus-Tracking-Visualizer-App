In this video, we will learn how we can create a Corona Virus Tracking and Visualization Application using JavaScript and Mapbox. We will perform clustering of points based on the countries and each cluster will represent a set of locations within it that are prone to COVID19. 
Some of the features of the application are : 
1. Clustering of points to represent set of regions for all the countries on the Map. 
2. Reverse Geocoding using Latitude and Longitude to get the place name and getting the number of deaths and number of confirmed cases for each location that is present within the country.
